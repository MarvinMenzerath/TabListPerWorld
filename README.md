# TabListPerWorld
This tiny Plugin modifies the Tab-List to show only those Players in the list, who are in the same World like you.  
So a Player in World "FreeBuild" won't see any other Player except the Players in this particular World.

## Install
Grab a current Release from [here](https://github.com/MarvinMenzerath/TabListPerWorld/releases) and copy it into your Plugins-Directory. That's it.
